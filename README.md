In this project, I built a financial market prediction API utilizing FastAPI and PyTorch. The API leverages historical stock and cryptocurrency data to forecast future price movements, offering a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

This project showcases my ability to combine machine learning, financial analysis, and backend development to create a scalable, data-driven application.
